The following scripts are adapted to Litecoin from the Bitcoin versions :-
ltc-hextoprivkey.pl
ltc-privkeytohex.pl
ltc-privkeytoaddr.pl

(Bitcoin versions are :-
btc-hextoprivkey.pl
btc-privkeytohex.pl
btc-privkeytoaddr.pl
)

It is assumed that 
(a)	Litecoin uses the same Elliptic Curve Cryptography secp256k1 standard as Bitcoin 
(b)	Litecoin addresses and private keys are constructed in the same way as Bitcoin except for the different 
	version prefixes (see below)
(c)	Litecoin uses the Bitcoin form of Base58 encoding

The changes which were made were :-

(1)	Different version prefixes for Litecoin :-
	Version prefix for Litecoin address		=	0x30
	Version prefix for Litecoin private key	=	0xB0

(2)	Assume that Litecoin address ALWAYS starts with an 'L'
	Assume that Litecoin WIF-uncompressed private key ALWAYS begins with '6'
	Assume that Litecoin WIF-compressed private key ALWAYS begins with 'T'

	These respectively follow from considering the Base58 encodings of the following :-
	30000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000								Lowest value	(25 bytes)
	30FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF								Highest value	(25 bytes)
	B0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000		Lowest value (37 bytes)
	B0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF		Highest value (37 bytes)
	B000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000	Lowest value (38 bytes)
	B0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF	Highest value (38 bytes)

	which are respectively :-
	LKDxGDJq5fF4FohAB8zJH24mDDNH8EzzBZ												Lowest value (Base58)
	LiZZFKc7nqhw5EqFCZKcm9LYqidDqUapVt												Highest value (Base58)
	6u823ozcyt2rjPH8Z2ErsSXJB5PPQwK7VVTwwN4mxLBFrT4JLXq								Lowest value (Base58)
	6w4mE3SeqJi5sCrqTbrrpm856C174e9zH8Y4BWkfwzBeM58GngE								Highest value (Base58)
	T33ydQRKp4FCW5LCLLUB7deioUMoveiwekdwUwyfRDeGZG1ZXD4s							Lowest value (Base58)
	TBdcCZnDzDALUbLxtQs4uokD3uZTm4zfpCG53QKkuhPyqbD6gcCn							Highest value (Base58)

(3)	Change the word 'Bitcoin' to 'Litecoin' where appropriate. In some cases the word 'Bitcoin' is left in
	(eg in function decode_bitcoin_base58, because the function is identical to the Bitcoin version).

Note that between the above 3 scripts certain functions are common and should be copied identically from one
to the other.

Changes made to the original Bitcoin scripts would mean a corresponding change should be made to the Litecoin versions,
though as these scripts are fairly 'atomic' in nature there should not be many such changes.
